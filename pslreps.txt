pslReps - Analyze repeats and generate genome-wide best alignments from a
sorted set of local alignments
usage:
    pslReps in.psl out.psl out.psr
where:
    in.psl is an alignment file generated by psLayout and sorted by pslSort
    out.psl is the best alignment output
    out.psr contains repeat info
options:
    -nohead            Don't add PSL header.
    -ignoreSize        Will not weigh as much in favor of larger alignments.
    -noIntrons         Will not penalize for not having introns when calculating
                       size factor.
    -singleHit         Takes single best hit, not splitting into parts.
    -minCover=0.N      Minimum coverage to output.  Default is 0.
    -ignoreNs          Ignore Ns when calculating minCover.
    -minAli=0.N        Minimum alignment ratio.  Default is 0.93.
    -nearTop=0.N       How much can deviate from top and be taken.
                       Default is 0.01.
    -minNearTopSize=N  Minimum size of alignment that is near top
                       for alignment to be kept.  Default 30.
    -coverQSizes=file  Tab-separate file with effective query sizes.
                       When used with -minCover, this allows polyAs
                       to be excluded from the coverage calculation.
