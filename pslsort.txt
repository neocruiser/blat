pslSort - Merge and sort psCluster .psl output files
usage:
      pslSort dirs[1|2] outFile tempDir inDir(s)OrFile(s)

   This will sort all of the .psl input files or those in the directories
   inDirs in two stages - first into temporary files in tempDir
   and second into outFile.  The device on tempDir must have
   enough space (typically 15-20 gigabytes if processing whole genome).

      pslSort g2g[1|2] outFile tempDir inDir(s)

   This will sort a genome-to-genome alignment, reflecting the
   alignments across the diagonal.

   Adding 1 or 2 to the dirs or g2g option will limit the program to only
   the first or second pass respectively of the sort.

options:
   -nohead      Do not write psl header.
   -verbose=N   Set verbosity level, higher for more output. Default is 1.
