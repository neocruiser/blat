pslPretty - Convert PSL to human-readable output
usage:
   pslPretty in.psl target.lst query.lst pretty.out
options:
   -axt             Save in format like Scott Schwartz's axt format.
                    Note gaps in both sequences are still allowed in the
                    output, which not all axt readers will expect.
   -dot=N           Output a dot every N records.
   -long            Don't abbreviate long inserts.
   -check=fileName  Output alignment checks to filename.
It's recommended that the psl file be sorted by target if it contains
multiple targets; otherwise, this will be extremely slow. The target and query
lists can be fasta, 2bit or nib files, or a list of these files, one per line.
